## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy to Render.com

### 4.1 Create Render Account

2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Authorize Render to access your repositories

### 4.2 Create Web Service

```env
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_from_twilio
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+14252875212
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_cloudflare_r2_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_cloudflare_r2_secret_key
R2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://abc123.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET_NAME=yesuway-church-media
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://media.yourcurch.org
```

### 4.4 Deploy

1. Click **Create Web Service**
2. Wait for deployment (3-5 minutes)
3. Note your app URL: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

---

## 📱 Step 5: Configure Twilio Webhook

### 5.1 Set Webhook URL

1. Go to Twilio Console → **Phone Numbers** → **Manage** → **Active numbers**
2. Click on your church phone number
3. In **Messaging** section:
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/webhook/sms`
   - **HTTP Method**: `POST`
   - **Status Callback URL**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/webhook/status`

### 5.2 Test Webhook

1. Send a test SMS to your church number
2. Check Render logs for activity
3. Visit `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health` to verify system status

---

## 🗄️ Step 6: Database Initialization

### 6.1 Remote Database Setup

Since Render doesn't provide SSH access, we'll initialize via endpoint:

1. Add temporary setup endpoint to your app (if not exists)
2. Or use the automatic initialization in app startup
3. Database will be created automatically on first run

### 6.2 Add Congregation Members

**Method 1: Direct Database Access (Recommended)**

Use a database viewer tool or add members via the setup script before deployment.

**Method 2: API Endpoint (Advanced)**

Create a temporary admin endpoint for member addition (remember to secure/remove after use).

---

## ✅ Step 7: Testing & Verification

### 7.1 System Health Check

Visit: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health`

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": {
    "active_members": 25,
    "recent_messages_24h": 0
  },
  "twilio": {
    "status": "connected"
  },
  "r2_storage": {
    "status": "connected"
  }
}
```

### 7.2 SMS Testing

1. **From Admin Phone**: Send "Hello test" to church number
2. **Expected**: All congregation members receive the message
3. **Check**: Render logs show successful delivery

### 7.3 Media Testing

1. **Send Photo**: From registered number
2. **Expected**: Everyone receives clean link like "Photo 1: https://..."
3. **Verify**: Link opens and shows image

### 7.4 Reaction Testing

1. **Send Message**: "Great sermon today!"
2. **Send Reaction**: "Loved 'Great sermon today!'" (from different phone)
3. **Expected**: No broadcast of reaction (stored silently)
4. **Wait**: Check for summary at 8 PM or after 30min silence

---

## 🔧 Step 8: Production Configuration

### 8.1 Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Render**: Go to Settings → Custom Domains
2. **Add Domain**: `sms.yourcurch.org`
3. **Update DNS**: Add CNAME record as instructed
4. **Update Twilio**: Change webhook to new domain

### 8.2 Monitoring Setup

1. **Health Checks**: Use [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) (free)
   - Monitor: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes
2. **Log Monitoring**: Check Render logs daily
3. **Cost Monitoring**: Set up Twilio usage alerts

### 8.3 Security Hardening

1. **Environment Variables**: Never expose in code
2. **Database Backups**: Set up regular backups
3. **Access Control**: Limit who can modify members
4. **SSL/HTTPS**: Ensure all endpoints use HTTPS

---

## 📚 Step 9: Documentation & Training

### 9.1 Document Your Setup

Create a simple guide for your church:

```markdown
# [YourChurch] SMS System

## For Members
- Send messages to: +1-425-287-5212
- All congregation receives your message
- Share photos/videos freely
- Text "HELP" for system info

## For Admins
- System Dashboard: https://your-app.onrender.com
- Member management: Contact tech team
- Emergency contact: [Your Contact]
```

### 9.2 Train Key Staff

1. **Pastor/Admin**: How to access dashboard and view stats
2. **Tech Team**: Member addition/removal process
3. **Ushers**: How to help members with questions

### 9.3 Announcement to Congregation

Sample announcement:

> 🏛️ **NEW: Church SMS System**
> 
> We're excited to announce our new church-wide SMS system! 
> 
> **How it works:**
> - Text anything to **+1-425-287-5212**
> - Your message goes to our entire congregation
> - Share photos, prayer requests, announcements
> - Everyone stays connected as one community
> 
> **First message:** Send "Hello everyone!" to test it out!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Webhook timeout"
**Solution**: Ensure webhook responds in <15 seconds
```javascript
// Return response immediately, process async
res.status(200).send('OK');
// Then process message asynchronously
```

### Issue: "Member not found"
**Solution**: Check database for member registration
```sql
SELECT * FROM members WHERE phone_number = '+1234567890';
```

### Issue: "Media not uploading"
**Solution**: Verify R2 credentials and bucket permissions

### Issue: "Messages not sending"
**Solution**: 
1. Check Twilio balance
2. Verify A2P 10DLC registration
3. Check rate limits

### Issue: "Database errors"
**Solution**: 
1. Check SQLite file permissions
2. Verify WAL mode enabled
3. Check disk space
